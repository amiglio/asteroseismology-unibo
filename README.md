# asteroseismology-unibo

in this repo I will upload material useful for the computer-lab component of the module "Advanced stellar evolution and Asteroseismology"


MESA tip:

If you wish to assign different names to the various runs (e.g. changing, mass, chemical composition, ...) you can set the file names adding these lines in the &controls section in the inlist_project file:


	star_history_name =    'NAME.track'
	profiles_index_name =  'NAME.index'
	profile_data_prefix =  'NAME_n'
